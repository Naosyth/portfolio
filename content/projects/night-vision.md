## About This Project

I have always been a huge fan of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, so one of the first things I did when I got my 3D printer was to model and print my own pair of Splinter Cell goggles. I wanted these to be functional night vision goggles, unlike a pair of goggles I had made a few years prior. This meant I would have to not only design the goggles to look fairly faithful to the original goggles from the game, but I would also have to design them with room for all of the necessary electronics.

## Designing The Goggles

I started the design process by mocking out what space would be required for the infra-red LED arrays, camera, near-eye displays and display encoder, and battery pack.

After setting aside room for the internals, I bagan designing the rest of the goggles. By designing them around the electronics, I had a sort-of built in scale reference, based on the pupil width of the near-eye display I was using.

## Printing and Assembling

As this was my first relatively large print, I ran in to several print quality issues. I had to make a lot of adjustments to my 3D printer, such as adjusting belt tension, print speeds, filament temperatures, and bed adhesion issues. After some finagling, I managed to get adequate results, but there was still a lot of finishing work required.

Before painting or permanently assembling everything, I did a test fit of the electronics to make sure everything matched my digital approximations.

## Finished Product

I initially planned on having the battery pack mounted to the back of the head strap, but it was pretty bulky, and I wasn't super confident that the battery wouldn't blow up, so I decided to place it farther away from my brain. The night vision actually works surprisingly well, especially in-doors. The near-eye displays I used are not very high resolution, and the camera has a fairly restricted field of view, so it is not the easiest to actually walk around it, but it met my goal of being a functional pair of night vision goggles.

## Final Thoughts

I definitely could have made many improvements to this project. I was rather in-experienced at 3D modeling when I started this, so some of the profiles are _very_ rought, and not very true to the game. I also did not take enough time sanding the parts after printing them. If I were to make a new pair of goggles, I would tone-down the infrared LED arrays. The arrays used in this project get extremely hot, probably hot enough to melt the plastic around them if left on long enough. I would also consider leaving one eye unobstructed, so that I can see where I am walking without distortion from having a very narrow field of view.
