## About This Project
GraphIt was my intern project at Originate in 2014. It is an Android app that tracks various metrics of the user's phone, such as battery level and screen-on time, and graphs the data over time. The goal of this project was to map trends in my phone usage over time, to see trends such as if I use my phone more or less during holidays, how my battery life declines as the battery gets older, or how much data I use on weekdays versus weekends.

## Technology
GraphIt was written with Java, and uses [AndroidPlot](http://androidplot.com/) for generating various plots and graphs.
